====================

Exercises done during the MakerSquare web dev course Aug-Nov 2014

This repo holds the exercises done for MakerSquare--both in-class and homework exercises. Since these exercises were primarily aimed at teaching me during this time, they may be of limited interest (unless you're trying to teach yourself Ruby, Rails, Javascript, etc.).

(Larger projects are in their own repos.)

Files marked with a * may be of more interest--or are merely exercises I'm proud of, either because they work well or because they show improvement over time.
